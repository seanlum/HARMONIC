# DevOps Lifecycle
Because DevOps, and DevSecOps, Administration, Product Development, and so many other types of technology involve multiple and perpetual lifecycles; DevOps is compatible. However, I felt that in order to improve the potential meeting cycles of the people who may use HARMONIC; I would like to introduce the HARMONIC DevOps lifecycle; with 2-3 added phases -- Planning, Improvement, and Integration.

By introducing planning, improvement, and integration; we can start leveraging parts of the lifecycle as part of the milestones in a project. Also, planning is critical; and even if you are implementing your project with Extreme Programming or other kinds of implementation strategies; you must emphasize planning.

Also, the reason why the DevOps lifecycle is being introduced with 10 steps was so it could be leveraged as a phase dependent lifecycle and a lifecycle for each stage of HARMONIC and DevOps. Again the steps for HARMONIC are:

```
H: Hardening
A: Assessment
R: Remediation
M: Monitoring
O: Orchestration (or Operations)
N: Normalization (or standardization/config management)
I: Integration (or continuous Integration)
C: Communication (or Collaboration)
```

To read more on what each part of HARMONIC means, please visit the [README.md file](README.md)

Here is more on how you can integrate DevOps as an optional "minicycle" or internal cycle to the HARMONIC lifecycle.

# 1. Planning
1. Planning
**Goal**: Clarify requirements, objectives, scope, and potential risks before coding begins.

### H (Hardening)

- Decide on security baselines and standards (e.g., CIS Benchmarks, NIST, DISA STIG).
- Include secure architecture/design principles in initial project planning.
### A (Assessment)

- Perform risk assessments early: identify critical data, regulatory constraints, threat modeling.
- Scope out which frameworks or compliance regimes will apply (e.g., PCI-DSS, HIPAA).
### R (Remediation)

- Capture known vulnerabilities from previous projects or common industry findings, and plan how to avoid them.
- Outline tasks needed to address legacy issues if you’re rebuilding or refactoring an existing system.
### M (Monitoring)

- Define logging and monitoring requirements (log sources, SIEM integrations).
- Plan for how you will measure success (KPIs, metrics, SLAs).
### O (Orchestration)

- Lay out automation pipelines needed for builds, tests, security scans, and deployments.
- Identify toolchains (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI, Ansible) and how they’ll integrate.
### N (Normalization)

- Define standard environments (dev, test, staging, prod) and ensure consistent configuration management from the start.
- Create a “golden image” approach or container base images for uniform deployment.
### I (Integration)

- Determine how security scanners, QA tools, and code repositories will integrate.
- Define integration points between dev teams, operations, security teams, and external vendors.
### C (Communication)

- Establish communication channels for cross-team collaboration, such as Slack, MS Teams, or Jira.
- Make sure security requirements are clearly articulated in project documentation and user stories.

# 2. Implementation

**Goal**: Begin coding or configuring systems according to the planned architecture and requirements.

### H (Hardening)

- Implement secure coding guidelines: input validation, output encoding, least-privilege patterns in code.
- Adhere to secure baseline configs in dev environments (e.g., disabling unnecessary services).
### A (Assessment)

- Keep track of known vulnerabilities or technical debt for future sprints.
### M (Monitoring)

- Begin instrumenting the code for logging (structured logs, trace IDs) and metrics (APM).
- Ensure that any changes to config files are captured by integrity monitoring solutions or version control.
### O (Orchestration)

- Set up CI/CD pipeline scripts for automated builds, tests, and potential deployments to test environments.

# Putting It All Together
HARMONIC is a holistic approach that ensures security, compliance, and operational excellence are not afterthoughts.

Each of the 10 steps (Planning through Integration) can and should address all parts of HARMONIC.
The specifics (e.g., exact scanning tools, risk metrics, orchestration platforms) will vary by organization, but the core principle remains:

Bake security, monitoring, and continuous improvement into every phase of the software/system lifecycle.

By mapping these HARMONIC considerations to the SDLC/DevOps steps, you create a powerful framework where security and reliability become systemic—instilled at every turn rather than patched on at the end. This not only reduces risk but also leads to higher-quality, more maintainable systems overall.
