# Security Standards and Methodologies

## Defense in Depth
Defense in Depth is a cybersecurity strategy that employs multiple layers of defense to protect information and systems. This approach ensures that if one layer fails, additional layers will still provide protection.

## Zero Trust Architecture
Zero Trust Architecture is a security model that assumes that threats could be both external and internal. It requires strict identity verification for every person and device trying to access resources on a private network, regardless of whether they are inside or outside the network perimeter.

## Principle of Least Privilege
The Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP) is a security concept in which users are granted the minimum levels of access – or permissions – needed to perform their job functions. This reduces the risk of accidental or intentional misuse of systems and data.

These methodologies and frameworks are essential for creating a robust security posture and are widely adopted in system hardening practices.
