# 1. Physical Security & Environment
### Facilities & Buildings
- **Physical Address(es)**: Office buildings, data centers, or co-working spaces.
- **Access Control Mechanisms**:
    - Key locks, smart cards, biometrics, keypads, or badge systems.
    - Visitor logs or sign-in sheets.
- **Monitoring Systems**: Security cameras, motion detectors, intrusion alarms.
- **Emergency Systems**: Fire suppression, backup generators, UPS (uninterruptible power supply).
### Physical Equipment
- Server racks and associated components (e.g., PDUs, cooling).
- Safes, lockable storage cabinets for sensitive documents or devices.

**Why it matters**: Physical theft or tampering can undermine all other security controls.

# 2. User & Identity Assets
### Personnel & Identity Records
- Employees, contractors, interns, and third-party vendors.
- Roles, job functions, group memberships, manager relationships, etc.
- User IDs for internal systems and external services.
### Access Credentials
- Credentials for building access (smart cards, key fobs, badges).
- Credentials for network or service access (username/password, tokens, SSH keys, certificates).
- Third-party integrations (OAuth tokens, API keys).

**Why it matters**: Unauthorized credential sharing or privileged account compromise is a leading attack vector.

# 3. Hardware & Device Inventory
### A. Enterprise Infrastructure

#### Servers (Physical & Virtual)
- Make/model, serial numbers, firmware versions.
- Host OS type and version (e.g., Windows Server, Linux distro).
- Purpose of each server (web server, database, CI/CD runner, etc.).
#### Networking Equipment
- Routers, switches, firewalls, load balancers, VPN gateways.
- Firmware versions, vendor, model, and licensing details.
- Configuration backups (e.g., VLANs, ACLs, routing tables).
#### Storage Systems

Firmware levels, capacity, encryption status.
### B. Endpoint Devices

#### Desktops & Laptops
- Make/model, serial number, OS type (Windows, macOS, Linux).
- Patch level, installed security software (AV/EDR), encryption status (BitLocker, FileVault, etc.).
#### Mobile Devices
**Corporate-owned vs. BYOD (Bring Your Own Device).**
- OS version (iOS, Android), patch level, encryption and MDM status.
- Apps installed, compliance with enterprise security policies (e.g., Mobile Device Management).
#### IoT & Peripherals
- Printers, scanners, smart TVs, smart meeting room devices.
- Firmware versions, network segments, default credentials changed?
### C. Development & Test Devices

- Dev kits, specialized hardware used in QA/Testing (e.g., embedded devices).

Often overlooked, but critical if they connect to internal networks or store sensitive data.

**Why it matters**: Every device is a potential entry point. Keeping track of versions, patch levels, and configurations helps you proactively address vulnerabilities.

# 4. Software Inventory
### A. Operating Systems

- Windows, Linux distributions, macOS, container OS (e.g., Alpine, Ubuntu base images).
- Patch levels, end-of-support deadlines, known vulnerabilities.
### B. Installed Applications

- Productivity suites (Office, Google Workspace), developer tools (Visual Studio, IntelliJ, Eclipse), collaboration tools (Slack, Teams), etc.
- Version numbers, licensing details, patch status.

### C. Server Applications & Services
- Web servers (Apache, Nginx, IIS), application servers (Tomcat, JBoss, etc.).
Database engines (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, MongoDB).
- Middleware, caching layers, message queues (RabbitMQ, Kafka).
- Cloud or on-prem container orchestration platforms (Kubernetes, Docker Swarm).
### D. Custom In-House Applications
- Microservices, monolithic apps, command-line tools, scripts.
- Deployment environment details (container images, VM images, bare metal).
### E. 3rd-Party & OSS Libraries

- Dependencies used by applications (NPM packages, Python modules, Maven or NuGet libraries, etc.).
- SBOM (Software Bill of Materials): Detailed inventory of all libraries/components and their versions.
- Why it matters: Software vulnerabilities (e.g., Log4Shell, Heartbleed) often reside in 3rd-party libraries. Knowing exactly what you have is crucial for quick remediation.

# 5. Project & Code Repositories
Version Control Repositories
- Git, SVN, etc., plus hosting solutions (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).
    - Branches, tags, commit history, and who has access.
    - Private vs. public repos, licensing constraints.
### Project Documentation

- Architecture diagrams, requirements, design docs, “readmes,” or wikis.
Build & Deployment Pipelines
- CI/CD systems (Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps).
- Deployment scripts, environment variables, secrets storage.

### Test Artifacts
- Automated test scripts, QA documentation, test data sets.
- Potentially sensitive data for test environments (mimic production data?).

**Why it matters**: Code repositories and build pipelines contain intellectual property and credentials (like API keys). They’re prime targets for attackers.

# 6. Cloud & Virtual Infrastructure
### Cloud Service Providers (CSPs)

- AWS, Azure, GCP, or other hosting providers.
- Services used (EC2, S3, RDS, Lambda, etc.).
- Resource configuration (security groups, IAM roles, storage buckets).

### SaaS Applications
- Hosted bug trackers (Jira), CRM systems (Salesforce), HR software (Workday), communication tools (Slack, MS Teams).
- User provisioning, single sign-on (SSO) configurations, admin privileges.

**Why it matters**: Cloud misconfigurations are among the most common breaches (e.g., open S3 buckets).

# 7. Network & Communication Channels
### Network Topology

- Physical vs. logical diagrams: subnets, VLANs, DMZs, VPN tunnels, WAN links.
- Wi-Fi networks (guest vs. corporate).
- Remote access solutions (VPN, Zero Trust Network Access).
### Communication Channels

- Email servers and services.
- Corporate chat or collaboration tools.
- VOIP or video conferencing systems.
### Security Tools & Appliances

- IDS/IPS, Web Application Firewalls, Endpoint Security solutions.
- SIEM systems (Splunk, QRadar, etc.), log management solutions.

**Why it matters**: Lateral movement by attackers often occurs once inside the network. A known map of network segments and security controls can help limit or detect this movement.

# 8. Data & Information Stores
### Data Classification

- Public, internal, confidential, regulated (PII, PHI, PCI data).
- Ownership, retention policies, encryption status (at rest/in transit).
### Databases & Data Lakes

- Structured (SQL databases) vs. unstructured (NoSQL, data lakes).
- Encryption (TDE, field-level encryption), backup policies, replication.
### File Systems & Collaboration Tools

- Shared drives (on-prem or cloud-based).
- Document management systems (SharePoint, Confluence).
- Access control lists, versioning, revision histories.

**Why it matters**: Data breaches often focus on extracting sensitive data. Knowing where it lives and who has access is essential for protecting it.

# 9. Licenses & Entitlements
### Software & Tool Licenses

- Paid vs. open-source usage, EULAs, maintenance contracts.
- Renewal dates, compliance for number of seats/users.
### Developer Tools & Plugins

- IDE plugins, API usage limits, subscription tiers.
Hardware Warranties & Support Contracts

- SLAs for critical hardware, renewal cycles, extended maintenance options.

**Why it matters**: Non-compliance or expired licenses can pose legal and operational risks. Missing support contracts can leave you exposed if critical hardware fails.

# 10. Policies, Procedures & Documentation
### Organizational Policies

- Security policies, acceptable use policies, data handling guidelines.
- HR policies around onboarding/offboarding employees.
Incident Response & Disaster Recovery Plans
- Where these documents reside, version control, next review date.
- Dependencies on particular resources or vendors.
### Change Management
Tracking how changes in configurations, software, or infrastructure are requested, approved, documented, and deployed.
Why it matters: Even the best technical controls can fail if employees are not following properly documented and enforced procedures.

# How Thorough Can You Be for a Single System Computer Network?
Even if you have just one physical server (or one small office network), the above categories still apply—just in smaller scale. The thoroughness comes from:

- Detail: Document the exact OS, firmware, installed software, versions, patch levels, and any special configuration.
- Connections: Even a single machine often has multiple inbound/outbound connections (remote management, logging, internet access, etc.).
- Physical & Environmental: Is the server locked up? Does it have UPS backup? Who can physically access it?
- Software & Data: That single system might host multiple applications, containers, or data stores. Each is an “asset” in its own right.
- Users & Credentials: Even if it’s only you, do you have separate admin vs. user accounts? How do you handle backups?
- Documentation & Procedures: A single system can be thoroughly documented so you can track changes, expansions, or migrations in the future.
- Key idea: Thoroughness is about depth (e.g., capturing firmware versions, OS patch levels, configurations) and breadth (e.g., also counting intangible assets like credentials, policies, code). Even with “only one system,” you can (and should) be extremely detailed in enumerating all these facets.

A full-spectrum inventory in a software company context isn’t just about listing physical assets—it’s about capturing everything that can affect security, availability, compliance, and ultimately business operations. This holistic approach ensures you’re able to:

- Quickly identify what needs updating or patching.
Know which systems or projects might be impacted by a newly disclosed vulnerability.
- Control access effectively and confidently.
Demonstrate compliance with regulations or customer audits.
- By methodically cataloging every type of asset—from the building’s locks to the latest microservice container images—you build a foundation for robust security operations, incident response, and strategic IT decision-making.
